# credit-card-fraud-detection
Credit card fraud detection identifies fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns in data. Using features like transaction time, amount, and anonymized variables (V1-V28), algorithms classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent. Effective detection reduces financial losses, enhances security, and improves trust in digital payment systems.


Structure
Index: A unique identifier for each transaction.

Time: The elapsed time (in seconds) from the first transaction in the dataset. It helps to analyze patterns over time.

V1, V2, ..., V19: These are anonymized features derived from the original transaction details using a dimensionality reduction technique like PCA (Principal Component Analysis). They are designed to preserve the privacy of the data while retaining its predictive power.

Fraud Detection Context: This dataset is likely used for building a machine learning model to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. Typically, in such datasets:

Features capture transaction behavior patterns (e.g., amounts, locations, user habits).

An additional label column (not shown here) is included to indicate whether the transaction was fraudulent.

Purpose
The goal is to train a model using these features to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent. By identifying suspicious patterns (e.g., unusual spending habits, large amounts, anomalies in time distribution), the model can effectively detect fraud in real-world credit card transactions.
